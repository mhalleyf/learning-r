## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Linear regression by hand
# Create a data frame with variables of correct answers and attitude
test.data <- data.frame(
  correct=c(17, 13, 12, 15, 16, 14, 16, 16, 18, 19),
  attitude=c(94, 73, 59, 80, 93, 85, 66, 79, 77, 91))

# y = a + bx or intercept + coefficient * x
# slope (b) of regression line b = r (sy / sx)
# where r is pearsons correlation coefficient
# y-intercept (a) of regression line a = yhat - b * xhat
# r = sum ((x-xhat)(y-yhat)) / sqrt((sum(x-xhat)^2) * (sum(y-yhat)^2))

xhat <- sum(test.data$correct) / length(test.data$attitude)
yhat <- sum(test.data$attitude) / length(test.data$attitude)


# x and y variance
xmxhat <- test.data$correct - xhat
ymyhat <- test.data$attitude - yhat

# xy variance
xyvar <- xmxhat * ymyhat

# x and y variance squared
xmxhatsq <- xmxhat^2
ymyhatsq <- ymyhat^2

# moderate to strong correlation coefficient
r <- sum(xyvar)/sqrt(sum(xmxhatsq) * sum(ymyhatsq))

# standard deviation of y is the sum of the squared residuals / n - 1 where n is the number of observations
sy <- sqrt(sum(ymyhatsq)/(length(test.data$attitude)-1))
sx <- sqrt(sum(xmxhatsq)/(length(test.data$correct)-1))

# we can now work out the slope or b by using pearsons r and the standard deviations of x and y
b <- r * (sy / sx)

# we can now work out the y-intercept
yint <- yhat - b * xhat

# we can now predict the values of y using inputed values of x
x <- c(10, 20, 30)
y <- yint + b * x

plot(y)

# now the math is understood, the lm function can do all of this for us
test.regression <- lm(attitude ~ correct, data=test.data)
summary(test.regression)

# the r squared in the summary tab is the same as r^2
r^2

# plot the data set and visualise how well the line fits the model
plot(test.data$correct, test.data$attitude)
abline(test.regression, col="blue")

# Create a data frame with variables of weight and size
mouse.data <- data.frame(
  weight=c(0.9,1.8, 2.4, 3.5, 3.9, 4.4, 5.1, 5.6, 6.3),
  size=c(1.4, 2.6, 1.0, 3.7, 5.5, 3.2, 3.0, 4.9, 6.3), 
  tail = c(0.7, 1.3, 0.7, 2.0, 3.6, 3.0, 2.9, 3.9, 4.0))

plot(mouse.data$weight, mouse.data$size)

# uses least squares method to estimate a line where formula= in lm is size as function of weight
mouse.regression <- lm(size ~ weight, data = mouse.data)

# Details outputs for model parameters
# Summary of residuals or distance from the data to the fitted line (symetrical min / max / 1Q / 3Q)
# Intercepts don't need to be statistically significant
# The standard error and t value are shown to help calculate p-values
# Coefficients show that for a 1 unit change in x, y will change by 0.778
# Residual standard error (square root of the denominator)
# Multiple R-squared shows weight explains 61% of the change in size
# F-statistic, degrees of freedom and p-value
summary(mouse.regression)

plot(mouse.data$weight, mouse.data$size)
abline(mouse.regression, col="blue")


# multiple linear regression - answers whether tail adds value to the prediction
plot(mouse.data$weight, mouse.data$tail)

# use weight and tail to predict size
plot(mouse.data)


# interpretation of multiple regression
multiple.regression <- lm(size ~ weight + tail, data=mouse.data)
summary(multiple.regression)

# in summary, using weight and tail to predict size is good
# but if we wanted to save time, we could spare ourselves from weighing mice and just use tail to predict size

tail.regression <- lm(size ~ tail, mouse.data)
summary(tail.regression)

# tails provide a much better prediction of size than weight does. Why is it unethical to remove weight?
plot(mouse.data$tail, mouse.data$size)
abline(tail.regression)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
