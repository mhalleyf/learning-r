## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Load dependant libraries
library(deSolve)
library(ggplot2)

# Set time period and step
START <- 2015
FINISH <- 2030
STEP <- 0.25
simtime <- seq(START, FINISH, by = STEP)

head(simtime)
tail(simtime)

```

``` {r}
library(microbenchmark)
library(plotrix)
library(plotly)
library(DescTools)


# Monte Carlo Simulation
run_time <- microbenchmark({
throw_dart <- 100
darts_in_circle <- 0

x = runif(n = throw_dart, min = -1, max = 1)
y = runif(n = throw_dart, min = -1, max = 1)

sum_squares <- x^2 + y^2
index_darts_in_circle <- which(sum_squares <= 1)
darts_in_circle <- length(index_darts_in_circle)

print(4 * darts_in_circle / throw_dart)
print(run_time)
}, times = 1)


for (i in 1:throw_dart) {
  plot(x[1:i], y[1:i], asp = 1, xlim = c(-1, 1), ylim = c(-1, 1))
  draw.circle(x = 0, y = 0, nv = 1000, radius = 1, border = "purple")
  points(x[i], y[i], col="blue")
  Sys.sleep(0.2)
}

f <- function(x) x^2
curve(f, from = -3, to = 3, xlim = c(-3,3), xaxs="i")
Shade(f, breaks =c(-3, 3), col="blue")
grid()

# Estimate area under the graph through simulation rather than integration
check_points <- runif(n = 1000, min = -3, max = 3)
6 * mean(f(check_points))

# Run a for loop to visualise how accurate the estimate of the area under the curve is for n iterations
area_estimates <- vector(length = 10000)
for(i in 1:10000) {
  check_points <- runif(n = i, min = -3, max = 3)
  area_estimates[i] <- 6 * mean(f(check_points))
}
plot(area_estimates)
abline(h = 18, col = "red", lwd = 1)


# Use Base R and Plotly for 3D visualisations
g <- function(x, y) x^2 + y^2
x <- y <- seq(-3, 3, length = 100)
z <- outer(x, y, g)
persp(x, y, z)

plot_ly(x = x, y = y, z = z) %>% add_surface()



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
