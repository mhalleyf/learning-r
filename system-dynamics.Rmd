## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Load dependant libraries
library(deSolve)
library(ggplot2)

# Set time period and step
START <- 2015
FINISH <- 2030
STEP <- 0.25
simtime <- seq(START, FINISH, by = STEP)

head(simtime)
tail(simtime)

```

``` {r}
library(microbenchmark)
library(plotrix)


# Monte Carlo Simulation
run_time <- microbenchmark({
throw_dart <- 100
darts_in_circle <- 0

x = runif(n = throw_dart, min = -1, max = 1)
y = runif(n = throw_dart, min = -1, max = 1)

sum_squares <- x^2 + y^2
index_darts_in_circle <- which(sum_squares <= 1)
darts_in_circle <- length(index_darts_in_circle)

print(4 * darts_in_circle / throw_dart)
print(run_time)
}, times = 1)


for (i in 1:throw_dart) {
  plot(x[1:i], y[1:i], asp = 1, xlim = c(-1, 1), ylim = c(-1, 1))
  draw.circle(x = 0, y = 0, nv = 1000, radius = 1, border = "purple")
  points(x[i], y[i], col="blue")
  Sys.sleep(0.2)
}



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
