## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r}
# Data wrangling using tidyverse (50-80% of the effort of a data science project)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(devtools)


# Access to full dataset
View(diamonds)

# Ability to string functions together on the same variable
diamonds$x %>%
  round(2) %>%
  mean()




```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
